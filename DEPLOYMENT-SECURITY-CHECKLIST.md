- [ ] **Verify rate limiting** is working correctly
- [ ] **Check security headers** are being sent
- [ ] **Test file upload security** with various file types

### Short-term (Within 1 week)
- [ ] **Conduct penetration testing** on production environment
- [ ] **Review audit logs** for any suspicious activity
- [ ] **Update monitoring alerts** for security events
- [ ] **Train team** on new security procedures
- [ ] **Document security procedures** for team

### Long-term (Within 1 month)
- [ ] **Schedule regular security audits** (monthly)
- [ ] **Implement automated security scanning**
- [ ] **Set up security monitoring dashboard**
- [ ] **Conduct security awareness training**
- [ ] **Review and update security policies**

## üîç Security Testing Commands

### Run Security Audit
```bash
node scripts/security-audit.js
```

### Test Rate Limiting
```bash
# Test login rate limiting (should fail after 5 attempts)
for i in {1..6}; do
  curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/auth/login \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"wrongpassword"}'
done
```

### Test Security Headers
```bash
curl -I https://your-domain.com
# Should show security headers: X-Frame-Options, CSP, HSTS, etc.
```

### Test Input Validation
```bash
# Test XSS prevention
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"<script>alert(1)</script>","email":"test@example.com","password":"Test123!@#"}'
```
